# Deep-Learning-notes

This repo contains my experiments with machine learning/ deep learning algorithms in python.<br>
Libraries used : NumPy, matplotlib <br>
A detailed description of the notebooks follows. <br>
1. <b>gaussian_kernel : </b>Implementation of the Gaussian radial bias function  
2. <b>SVM_rbf : </b>running the SVM with rbf kernel on a randomly generated dataset and plotting the decision boundary  
3. <b>random_datasets : </b>a collections of datasets, which were generated randomly with simple mathematical manipulations
